# Constrained-Optimization-Purchase

This knapsack-like problem assumes you have a list of items you would like to buy and several suppliers, but you can only spend a certain number of dollars on each supplier due to budget/contracting constraints. 

The inputs are the amount you can spend at each supplier, a list of items you would like to buy (with quantity), and an array of how much each item costs at each supplier. I built my own optimization algorithm in the style of the knapsack problem. The output is an array of how many of each item you should buy from each supplier.

The actual knapsack problem algorithms are probably more efficient and offer better answers, but I solved this my own way without looking at them.
